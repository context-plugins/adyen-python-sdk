# Result Code 2

The result of the payment. For more information, see [Result codes](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/payment-result-codes).

Possible values:

* **Authorised** – The payment was successfully authorised. This state serves as an indicator to proceed with the delivery of goods and services. This is a final state.
* **Received** – Indicates the payment request was successfully received by Adyen, and will be processed. This is the initial state for all payments.
* **Pending** – The payment order was successfully received but the final status of the payment is not available yet. This is common for payment methods with an asynchronous flow.
